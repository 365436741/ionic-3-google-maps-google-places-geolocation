This repository is part of an ionic tutorial about Maps! In this tutorial we merged Google maps, Geolocation and Google Places, three of the most important features when we talk about location based apps, into one functional and easy to understand example so you can master the concepts behind location based apps. This ionic tutorial includes a working example you can reuse for your needs!
